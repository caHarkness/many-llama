# Sessions

The **sessions** view is a directory listing of all the JSON files in the `sessions/` directory relative to this project.

Choose a **session** from the list of available sessions or provide a name in the search field and click the blue right arrow button to create a session by that name. By entering text in the search field, you will also filter session threads by their display name and the content of their preview. If you name a session that already exists, you will be taken to that session.



To learn more about what an individual session is, enter a session and view the help documentation on it.
